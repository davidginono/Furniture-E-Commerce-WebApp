Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Bigsofa furniture e-commerce web app.

## Summary
Successfully integrated Vercel Web Analytics into the React + Vite project to enable visitor tracking and analytics collection.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **src/App.jsx**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
   - Wrapped the Routes component with a fragment and added the `<Analytics />` component
   - The Analytics component is now rendered at the app root level to track all page views and user interactions

### Files Modified (Dependencies):
2. **package.json** (updated via npm install)
   - Added: `@vercel/analytics: ^1.6.1` to dependencies

3. **package-lock.json** (updated via npm install)
   - Updated with new dependency entries for @vercel/analytics and its transitive dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Framework: React + Vite
For React applications (including those built with create-react-app or Vite), Vercel Web Analytics provides the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`.

### Integration Approach
- The Analytics component was added to the root App component as a sibling to the Routes
- This ensures it's initialized once when the app mounts and tracks all page navigation and events
- The component is wrapped in a Fragment to avoid structural changes to the existing layout

### Route Support
With the Analytics component imported from `@vercel/analytics/react`, the library automatically:
- Detects route changes using React Router hooks
- Tracks page views automatically as users navigate between pages
- Collects performance metrics and user interaction data

## Verification
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ Package installed correctly (v1.6.1)
✓ No breaking changes to existing code structure
✓ Import statement properly added to dependencies

## Next Steps (for the team)
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the app to Vercel
3. Monitor analytics data in the dashboard after deployment
4. Consider adding custom events using `@vercel/analytics/react` for specific user interactions (button clicks, form submissions, etc.) if needed

## Notes
- The project uses React Router for navigation, which is fully compatible with @vercel/analytics
- Once deployed to Vercel, the analytics will automatically collect data from the `/_vercel/insights/view` endpoint
- No configuration changes needed in vite.config.js or other build files
- The implementation follows Vercel's official React documentation for Web Analytics integration
